Description
-----------

`toscawidgets2 (tw2)`_ aims to be a practical and useful widgets framework
that helps people build interactive websites with compelling features, faster
and easier. Widgets are re-usable web components that can include a template,
server-side code and JavaScripts/CSS resources. The library aims to be:
flexible, reliable, documented, performant, and as simple as possible.

`polymaps`_ is a JavaScript library for image- and vector-tiled maps using SVG.

This module, tw2.polymaps, provides `toscawidgets2 (tw2)`_ widgets that render `polymaps`_ maps!
